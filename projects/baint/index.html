<p>I decided to stop this project, however I learned a lot with this one.</p>
<h1 id="the-idea">The Idea</h1>
<p>The idea was planted inside of my head while watching <a href="https://twitch.tv/tsoding">Tsoding</a> on twitch.tv.</p>
<p>Tsoding was developing his <a href="https://github.com/tsoding/nn.h">neural network library in c</a> at the time.</p>
<p>He was working on a widget for his shape recognition neural network.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fST6s4aOxuE&#x26;list=PLpM-Dvs8t0VZPZKggcql-MmjaBdZKeDMw">Neural Network in C that Recognizes Shapes on YouTube</a>)</p>
<p>Tsoding used <a href="https://github.com/raysan5">raysan5’s</a> <a href="https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/">raylib</a> and his own <a href="https://github.com/tsoding/olive.c">olive.c</a> to implement this widget.</p>
<p>I was blown away by the simplicity of this widget. So I wanted to create my own painting thing.</p>
<p>My mind immediately went to a full painting application because <em>How hard could it be?</em></p>
<h1 id="first-steps">First Steps</h1>
<p>I thougt to myself, it would be cool to create an app like that. I took a note. I always do.</p>
<p>So the time came, I was ready to start this project.</p>
<h2 id="choosing-the-technology">Choosing the technology</h2>
<p>I thought: <em>If Tsoding used C, olive.c, and raylib, I could too.</em></p>
<p>So I did. The project started using C, raylib, and olive.c.</p>
<p>I also wanted to use <a href="https://github.com/raysan5/raygui">raygui</a> by raysan5 for buttons and stuff like that.</p>
<h2 id="the-realization">The Realization</h2>
<p>I quickly realized that I cannot program in C. <em>Well…</em></p>
<p>I could create basic loops, functions and other regular stuff.</p>
<p>However, I lacked the ability to control the flow of the program.</p>
<p>I wanted to have a confirmation message box about saving an already-existing file.</p>
<p>It was supposed to show when a button was pressed,</p>
<p>however when the button was pressed, it would only show for a single frame and disappear.</p>
<p>This is when I decided to stop working on this project and give up.</p>
<h1 id="the-switch">The Switch</h1>
<p>After some time and thought I decided I could switch to another language and try again.</p>
<p>I had some experience with Java and C++ (OOP in general) so I decided to go with C++.</p>
<p>So I wrote the app from nothing, using some snippets of C code, in an object oriented manner.</p>
<p>It worked. And it felt great. I was finally able to work on a project that would actually work.</p>
<h2 id="the-wall">The Wall</h2>
<p>I hit a wall. I said it worked, but it did not work well.</p>
<p>There would be huge gaps when mouse was movied quickly on the canvas.</p>
<p>I wanted to give up but I decided to give it one more go, using AI this time.</p>
<p>I struggled for a couple of days to make it work with ChatGPT, and this only ensured me in how sh*t AI is.</p>
<p>But I was finally able to fix the issue, it somehow worked.</p>
<p>The code was very ugly though, but I had to move on with the project.</p>
<h2 id="the-use-of-shaders">The Use of Shaders</h2>
<p>I wanted to have this cool checker pattern in the background of the canvas.</p>
<p>It couldn’t be filled pixels obviously, it had to be a shader on the canvas background.</p>
<p>This was my first time writing real shaders in GLSL. It did not go well at first,</p>
<p>but it worked in the end. I combined the use of AI and “stealing code” from <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/">shadertoy</a>.</p>
<h1 id="working-on-the-gui">Working on the GUI</h1>
<p>At some time in the development, I can’t remember when exactly (this was like 2 years ago),</p>
<p>I decided I won’t use raygui and I will make my own GUI inside of the app.</p>
<p>I unknowingly complicated the whole thing by this decision. The UI was janky and ugly, with goofy icons</p>
<p>made in libresprite. The only decent looking thing was the menu bar. It worked almost perfectly.</p>
<p>I made quite a lot GUI controls in this project, with a little help from the raygui source code.</p>
<p>I had buttons, widgets (little windows inside of the app), the menu bar, and a lot of inputs.</p>
<h1 id="things-to-do">Things To Do</h1>
<p>At some point, again I can’t exactly remember, I decided to write down TODOs for this project.</p>
<p>There were quite a lot of them. I had ideas for this project like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Undo/Redo (which I did, but guess what, it was very laggy and did not really work)</li>
<li>Better shaders and better selection (with my shader knowledge at the time, almost impossible)</li>
<li>Tools like magic selection or even text</li>
<li>Custom color palettes and color pickers (I basically reused raygui’s code for the pickers)</li>
<li>Layering system</li>
<li>Image Filters, like blurs, inversion, color selection/replacement</li>
</ul>
<p>This was a lot. I sometimes looked at the TODO list and thought: <em>It would be cool to do it one day</em>.</p>
<p>That day never came.</p>
<h1 id="a-decision">A Decision</h1>
<p>Every time I opened Visual Studio Code (my text editor of choice at the time)</p>
<p>I looked at the code for 5 minutes and closed the editor. I was not able to work on the project.</p>
<p>I decided to work on other projects, play around with other stuff, play games or watch movies,</p>
<p>and come back after a while. I did come back, to the same feeling.</p>
<p>I thought about it and decided to quit this project forever.</p>
<p>After some time more thoughts started coming. <em>Maybe the goal was set too high</em>,</p>
<p><em>Maybe the libraries I used weren’t right for this type of software</em>,</p>
<p><em>Maybe C++ is not that good after all</em>, and many many more.</p>
<p>And honestly, all of the above were right. I did set a goal too high.</p>
<p>I did use unfinished, untested libraries. Libraries not intended for this type of applications.</p>
<p>Maybe I used them in a wrong way, maybe not.</p>
<p>And C++… Yeah I think I hated this language for a great while after deciding to quit this project.</p>
<h1 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h1>
<p>It’s not like quitting a project is a waste of time. Most of the time you learn a lot</p>
<p>doing new stuff. And so did I.</p>
<h2 id="do-not-use-c">Do not use C++</h2>
<p>Lesson 1 - Do not use C++ (or OOP in general). I started with Object Oriented Programming, and</p>
<p>the unfortunate truth is that my mind will, for a long time, thing about stuff in terms of objects.</p>
<p>Object Oriented is not always the right way to go, even if something doesn’t work in procedural,</p>
<p>or even functional (I’m kinda scared of functional programming tho, maybe because of the OOP start).</p>
<p>The solution to my problem with a message box would be to set a global variable or a state variable</p>
<p>assigned to a message box being open, check with an if in the main loop, and there we go.</p>
<p>It’s that easy, but because of this issue I switched to a whole another language.</p>
<h2 id="do-not-use-make">Do not use Make</h2>
<p>Lesson 2 - Do not use weird build systems.</p>
<p>I wanted to make it a proper C++ and use make like a proper C++ developer.</p>
<p>Make is hell honestly, it’s not good, and CMake is even worse. It’s slow and the syntax is confusing.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s a skill issue from my side. Maybe not.</p>
<p>The first edition of baint used shell scripts to build, another great thing I learned from Tsoding.</p>
<p>Nearing the end of the project i switched to <a href="https://github.com/tsoding/nob.h">nob.h</a>. A great</p>
<p>tool by Tsoding. It uses a nobuild philosophy:</p>
<p>programs should be built by the language they are written in.</p>
<p>Anyone can make a build system in any language, it’s not only limited to C or C++.</p>
<p>You can even use nob.h for projects not connected to C in any way.</p>
<h2 id="do-not-use-ai-for-programming">Do not use AI for programming</h2>
<p>Lesson 3 - do not stupidify yourself with AI.</p>
<p>I admit - I have used AI for this project like I mentioned before but for some other projects</p>
<p>on my github as well. And I will not use it for programming again. It’s a great search engine</p>
<p>replacement though.</p>
<p>AI is really bad at working with projects that have over 100 lines of code and any complexity.</p>
<p>The code AI generates most of the time doesn’t work, needs correction anyway, or doesn’t follow</p>
<p>the style of the code provided. It’s harder to program with AI because you have to correct its</p>
<p>mistakes.</p>
<h2 id="do-proper-research">Do proper research</h2>
<p>Lesson 4 - Do proper research about libraries you want to use.</p>
<p>If you see a cool library, check if it’s even usable. Maybe the author left a note that</p>
<p>this particular library you want to use is not finished and should not be used.</p>
<p>It’s fine to play around with libraries like that, but using them for real projects is not.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>I probably learned a lot more than mentioned above. C++ specific stuff like lambdas, weird and</p>
<p>quirky pointers, etc.</p>
<p>I would write more if I remembered more, however the last commit was 1 year ago according to github.</p>
<p>It’s 2025-06-19 as I’m writing this.</p>
<p>I would like to explore this idea in the future. Make a proper painting application, or even</p>
<p>an image editor. Something like GIMP but way simpler.</p>
<p>The source code will stay private because I’m ashamed of this code, but on the other note -</p>
<p>I’m nowhere near popular enough for people to look at my random projects.</p>
<p>:wq!</p>
