In my [about](https://zielinus.xyz/) page I say this:

> I would consider myself a programmer.

What did I mean by that?

What does being a programmer mean?

What does a programmer do?

What do I think it means?

What do other people thing it means?

I will explore all of these questions and more in this article.

# The Question

So let's begin with basics. A question, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question),

is an utterance with request for information. This question is not a [rhetorical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetorical_question) one,

because it requests information, an answer.

## The Construction

The question *Who is a programmer?* is comprised of **4** words.

These words are:

- *"Who"* - an [interrogative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_interrogative_words) and a [relative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_relative_words) pronoun
- *"is"* - a [copula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_(linguistics)), a linking verb
- *"a"* - an [indefinite article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_(grammar)#Indefinite_article)
- *"programmer"* - an entity, a [subject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_(grammar)) to the question

Let's explore these words and their meaning one by one.

### Who

Like mentioned in the list above, it's an interrogative or a relative pronoun.

What does that mean?

- interrogative pronoun:

Interrogative pronouns are used for asking open-ended questions and closed-ended questions.

- relative pronoun:

Most of relative pronouns are the same as interrogative pronouns.

These are not used in the question setting so it doesn't need explaining.

In this case *"Who"* is used in a [predicative expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicative_expression), meaning

it is an expression that follows a copula. In this case it is a question, so things are reversed,

and the copula follows the expression.

The most important thing about this predicative expression is that it is directly

related to a subject or an object.

### is

Like mentioned in the list above, the word *"is"* is a copula, a linking verb.

A copula is used for linking the subject to a [subject complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_complement).

A subject complement is a predicative expression, in the case of this question

it's more or less *"Who"*.

### a

Like mentioned in the list above, *"a"* is an indefinite article.

In English there are only **2** indefinite articles that don't refer to a specific entity.

These are *"a"* and *"an"*.

Indefinite articles are used to introduce a new entity or an object which can be referred to

in the next sentence. Or by a peer in a case of a discussion.

### programmer

Like mentioned in the list above, it is a subject to the question.

One of the two main parts of a sentence. The subject can refer to an entity, a person, or an object.

And anything in between.

### Bonus: ?

A question mark. It's a punctuaction mark indicating a question.

~

So now applying all that knowledge a proper question is constructed.

## The Meaning

What do I really mean by that question?

I guess I just wanted to be safe and clarify that *"a programmer"*

It is strengthened by the word *"Who"*. In the case of *"What is a programmer?"*, the programmer

would relate to an object, likely a device that can be used to program things.

# What does it mean now?

## Wikipedia

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer), a programmer is a job title.

While this could be right, more suitable job title nowadays is a *software engineer*.

## Wordnik

There are quite a few definitions of the word *programmer* on [Wordnik](https://www.wordnik.com/words/programmer).

There are a couple not related to my question, but most of these boil down to:

*Someone who writes computer programs*.

~

These definitions are quite modest. Especially for these times and the current programming culture.

The truth is modern *programmers* don't exactly fulfill the definition, even the simplest and clearest

one. Instead they call themselves *programmers* based on the vibe or the idea of being one.

~

Some people would call themselves *programmers* and won't actually write any software.

Some people would call themselves *programmers* and create websites.

> Is making websites programming?

I don't think so. At least if it's not a web app. Just a static web page.

Creating websites is closer to creative work like 3D modeling, creating music, drawing, etc.

Creating web applications however, is closer to programming than just creating websites.

It requires basic programming knowledge like loops, functions, variables, and such.

~

In these times people will call themselves *programmers* and post 30 minute long videos to youtube

talking about the latest thing.

The latest web dev library. The latest SaaS. The latest everything. Nothing about programming tho.

Yet they still have something like *a software engineer* or *a programmer* in their bio.

Who knows, maybe they like to create software in private, and they create this retarded type of

content only for money. Hey, if that's true - then fair game. If that makes you money, good for you.

~

I also heard something like:

> A coder only writes code, a programmer writes code, debugs it, does version control

So it introduced a new word, *coder*.

I can see how it is different from *programmer* using that definition.

But in principle they both mean the same thing.

- *programmer* - someone who creates software
- *coder* - someone who writes code

I guess you could make a distinction that every programmer is a coder but not every coder

is a programmer. Because you have to write code to create software, but you don't need to

test your code to just write it.

It just adds more unnecessary complexity to already existing problem with the definition.

~

It's kinda like the problem with modern pronouns. People will tell you that you can be anyone.

Just like these programmer phonies. They will tell you that anyone can be a programmer.

That is not true. In both cases. However you can call yourself anything, and you can believe in that.

~

So there's a little issue with the word *programmer* and its meaning in these days.

It seems like every other person has their own definition. And this is not cool, not cool at all.

# What did it use to mean?

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer#History) mentions some more known and some

less known names in the history section of the *Programmer* article.

People mentioned here actually had the will to explore this stuff. They were fascinated by

the complexity and the simplicity of these machines.

They wanted to create their own things.

They read and wrote books about this stuff. They used crappy and early hardware and had to make

everything efficient. It was not as easy as just asking the new LLM to write some python code.

They actually had to read the documentation, and if it didn't exist they had to do everything

themselves.

Look at the people who created Linux. This is the mostly used operating system on this planet.

Look at the people who created robust programming languages like C or C++.

They weren't affraid of failure. They also wanted to create something good. Something usable.

And they were willing to do it. And they did do it.

They did not really treat programming as a job, they just did it because they liked it.

This is where Wikipedia's meaning actually works the best.

> An author of computer source code

Or at least that is what I think.

# Other Meanings

There are a couple of other meanings for a word *programmer*, like I said before,

it could mean a device that is used to program something. Like an EEPROM programmer.

But in this article, like I said before, I'm using the word *programmer* to refer to a person.

But still, this word is used in not software-related worlds as a description or a title

for a person.

## Creating Programs

A programmer could be a person creating programs. Not software or computer programs.

The word program has a lot of meanings.

> A set of structured activities; a plan of action

or

> A set of principal goals which are supported by a political party [...]

or

> A performance of a show or other broadcast on radio or television

So a programmer (not related to computers) could create programs for television or radio.

A person like that could also create a set of structured activities, a plan of action

for whatever purpose, anything.

Or a person like that could create political programs meant to be implemented after

winning an election or otherwise.

Programming can be related to time management.

## Visual Programming

There do exist visual programming *languages*. It is partially related to software.

There are tools like [scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/). Or even node system in tools like [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) or [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US).

Visual Programming is just connecting nodes to form certain conditions that can be used

by another program to execute whatever is programmed with the nodes.

## Music Programming

Music Programming is creating music through computer software. This is mostly electronic music

but not always. Music programming utilizes sequencers, samplers, and synthesizers.

## Lighting Programming

Related to music programming. Light programming is creating instructions for a set of

lights to execute certain movements. It is mostly used for live shows to provide

a layer of immersion for the participants.

# What does it mean to me?

I guess my definition of a programmer is closer to what it once meant.

A person willing to explore weird nerdy stuff about computers.

A person writing software from scratch, or using lower-level libraries.

By lower-level I don't actually mean assembly (although low-level actually is assembly).

And that is one thing that really changed. I'm not a programmer long enough to observe changes

like these but I can observe others. I use lots of different types of software so I can tell tho.

Once assembly was the only way to program. Then C. C was considered high-level. And it still should

be. You don't write direct CPU instructions in C, tho you can. Now people say C is low level

because you have to manage the memory yourself.

A real programmer in my opinion is also someone who does not rely on AI at all.

In terms of programming of course. It's a great search engine tho. It's also very useful

for generating ideas like names for projects and stuff like that. But for code - absolute garbage.

And the most important thing, in my opinion, is that a real programmer could do what he has to

in any sane environment. Your main language is Rust, you should be able to program in C.

And vice-versa. Or you're familiar with OOP, you should be able to program in procedural.

Or at least learn how to do so, if you have to, or want to of course.

If you don't have to, or don't want to program in functional style, then there's no point in

learning that **particular** style.

So let's make a list, a definition, of what I think a real programmer is:

- Not affraid of exploring weird, low-level, but also high-level stuff
- Does not rely on AI
- Is able to use the documentation properly
- Writes *clean* code
- Can do the required work in any **sane** environment

There are 2 things I did not mention before the list.

Using the documentation and writing clean code. Clean code is also a very confusing term.

But it's simple. Clean code is just a readable and repurposable code.

Readable means that it can be read easily, with no trouble, and preferably no comments.

Variable names, function names, and others should be named properly.

Repurposable means that you can write a piece of code that can be used in another environment

or another software.

# What's next for programmers?

I don't really know. But I don't think it's good. With AI being so strong these days.

And I'm not saying AI will replace us (programmers). I'm saying people will come, call

themselves programmers, and use AI to generate code instead of actually writing the code.

I mean we already have the term *vibe coding*. I don't really know what it means and I don't really

care. I think it's something like writing code assisted by AI or something.

I think there will be a group of programmers, perhaps with a different name, actually doing

programming. Just like after digitalization of art, there still are artists painting real stuff

on a canvas with actual paint. And I don't mean this weird modern art. I mean the actual art.

# Conclusion

Perhaps calling myself a programmer was wrong. Perhaps I should have called myself something like

> A person willing to explore weird, low-level, high-level and nerdy sides of software

> A person writing readable and repurposable code

And more. But it's just too long. *programmer* is a widely used word, and most people have

the vague idea of what it means.

Writing this has been fun. I might write articles for my blog more often than twice a year.

Also a great English linguistics learning experience for me.

I am not a native English speaker so if I made any mistakes in the explaining part,

or any logical mistake, or any mistake at all in here, and you want to correct me, you can

send me an e-mail at [me@zielinus.xyz](mailto:me@zielinus.xyz) or message me on [discord @zielino](https://discord.com).

If you have any comments or questions you can also send me an e-mail or message me on discord.

If anyone is reading this then have a good day and just think about stuff sometimes.
