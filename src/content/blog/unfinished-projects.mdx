If you are independently working on your personal project, you might not finish it.

This doesn't only apply to programming. It applies to any project. In any field.

Unfinished projects are good and bad for you at the same time.

So, in this article I will explore the benefits and drawbacks of unfinished projects.

# A Picture

I can't remember where I've seen this picture. I can't find it on the internet either.

So I will just describe the image.

Picture this:

In the background there are unfinished houses, one of them is just built on grass from wooden

beams; it is not finished, there is only the frame of the house. One of the houses

is built with bricks but without cement to connect and join these bricks together;

it is not finished, there are only 2 walls built. One of them has concrete foundations and

some metal rods coming out of it; it is not finished as well.

There are some tools laying around these unfinished houses, like hammers and nails around

the first house, with wooden beams. Some bricks and a level around the second house. A concrete

mixer and some shovels around the concrete foundation; this house is not finished too.

In the foreground there is a man building a house. Only this time it is built properly,

with proper concrete foundations, tough structure. He is holding some tools that he used to make

this house. It is almost finished. It only needs some polish.

# The Point

With that description we can derive a couple of things about unfinished projects.

## Experience

You gain experience in the field your project is by just working on it. You don't have to finish it.

By taking on a new project, preferably a more difficult one than the last one, you have to

learn new things to at least go somewhere with that project. And by doing so you gain experience

in the field. Whatever you do. It's just the truth, doesn't need much explaining.

Just like the man trying to build a house. Tried to build a house from wood, did not succeed.

Then tried to build a house from bricks, did not succeed. Then tried to start with concrete

foundations, did not finish. But the man gained experience in building parts of a house.

And then he was finally able to build an actual house using his experience for every house part.

## Foundations

Not only do you gain experience by working on a project, you also build foundations for

your future self. You get to learn what you did right and what you did wrong. Sometimes

these things come to you only after you decide to leave the project unfinished.

Like the man from the picture, every house he tried to build was some sort of foundation

material for his future house. So a person with right foundation material will be able to build

something that actually works, and something one can actually finish.

The point doesn't really need a separation but I thought it looked better.

I guess the distinction is that experience is immediate, though most of the time only can use it

after the project but perhaps in some cases the experience can be utilized in the project itself.

And foundations is a thing for a future project, something you can base the future project on.

Something sturdy and tough; something that won't fail.

# Getting Sh\*t Done

Unfinished projects are not that bad. You learn stuff, you gain experience, you build foundations

for your future self. But you can't do that forever. At some point you have to finish a project.

Sometimes you just have to accept that you f\*cked up somewhere while working on the project,

and the result won't be as good as you wanted it to be. An endless loop of unfinished projects

is no good. Because what's the point of learning and all that stuff if you can't apply it in the

next project? There probably is a golden ratio of unfinished and finished projects. And I guess

that is personal to everyone. One might prefer to have more unfinished projects and learn

as much as possible. One might prefer to have more finished projects.

# Finishing a Project

*Can you even finish a project?*

I guess that depends on a person, again. I wanted to make a point that you can never finish a

project because you will always come up with something to add. Some TODO or some more polish,

optimizations and whatnot. But perhaps someone can finish a project. Someone that is willing

to accept that their project will never be perfect.

# My Experience

I have failed so many times. And I have so many unfinished projects. I always learns something

new tho. Don't use OOP, or don't use Qt6 or CMake. Stuff like that. Something that will make

my next project actually nice to work on. This is a blessing and a curse for me, because

I can learn so much but I can't finish anything. So far at least.

I noticed a pattern though. The project that I leave unfinished follow this pattern:

1. Big idea.
2. Huge motivation to work on the project.
3. Motivation gone.
4. Long break.
5. A spark of hope.
6. Decision to abandon the project.

But this is a thing I learned as well, which may or may not help me finish the project I'm working

on right now. I relied on motivation instead of discipline. Then I got lazy, took a big break,

like a month or two of doing nothing or just playing around with some stuff. Then I just left

the project unfinished. So maybe this time I should rely on discipline, which is harder.

And I just can't make long breaks. No breaks at all. Work on a project every day.

So what about the breaks? Perhaps these were caused by burnout, or burning out the motivation.

So I didn't feel like working on a project anymore.

# Conclusion

Unfinished projects are good for you in moderation. You just have to find a good ratio

of finished and unfinished projects for yourself. That is said assuming that you have a problem

with unfinished projects like me. And also this article is copium for me. But it's a healthy and

a true cope. It's not like you don't learn anything from unfinished projects. If you don't then

you're clearly doing something wrong. It's just learning from your mistakes.
