# There is nothing to see here

Why would you even look here?

Literally no one cares about any blog but I might post something here in the future just for logging purposes.

I often experience burnout, and I have no idea why is it so often.

Do I work on projects that I do not enjoy working on, or am I trying to make something that is too hard for me to make?

How else would I learn anything tho?
