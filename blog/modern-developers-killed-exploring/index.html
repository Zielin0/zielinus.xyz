<sup>This will be a little rant with some deviations from the main topic.</sup>
<h2 id="the-realization">The realization</h2>
<p>I was working on a project recently. A project which is a <em>chat app</em> just for pure educational and exercising purposes.</p>
<p>This application uses all of these mentioned technologies:
threads, TCP sockets, SSL, sqlite3, and more. This project is also made in the C programming language.</p>
<p>While taking a little break from working on that particular project I realized that I was <em>affraid</em> of
using these technologies and libraries. I was affraid because while I was learning programming
it was introduced to me that C is a very low-level language, that you can break a lot of things using threads,
that creating raw TCP sockets is hard and you’d be better just using some express.js framework or whatever.</p>
<p>Turns out it’s not that hard, difficult or scary. C is not a low-level language. Assembly is though.</p>
<h2 id="first-steps-in-programming">First Steps in Programming</h2>
<p>I started learning programming from YouTube tutorials as one would do. And while learning I wasn’t really learning programming.
I was learning programming languages and frameworks/libraries. I can remember trying to make a discord bot and eventually getting not so bad at it.
And then trying to make some interactive website with JavaScript. I couldn’t do that. I could not do that because I did not learn JavaScript while building discord bots.
I learned the discord.js library which was used to make bots for discord.</p>
<h2 id="exploring">Exploring</h2>
<p>When I got a little bit more advanced, but not too much, I decided to explore more things and concepts in programming.
I still could not understand some of the basic concepts which are very useful now but I started to explore.
I tried out a lot of different languages and environments and I learned a lot more things doing that.
Not only about programming concepts but also about the programming culture that exists whether anyone talks about it or not.</p>
<h2 id="breakthrough">Breakthrough</h2>
<p>And then I discovered this streamer called Tsoding. I discovered his project by having this annoying YouTube video
in my feed for a couple of days. I just dismissed it but then I was like <em>The title sounds interesting, let me see that</em>.
And that is probably what changed my way of looking at things in programming.</p>
<p>His way of thinking about programming is like thinking about games. Do it for fun. He called this <em>Recreational Programming</em>.
I was amazed how much I can learn from a single video and then followed his channel on twitch and started watching his streams.
The amount of knowledge I gained from this channel and from this person is truly amazing.</p>
<h2 id="thinking-about-a-future-job">Thinking about a future job</h2>
<p>When I was learning programming I was imagining in my head who I want to be. At that time I was like 13 or maybe 14 years old.
I was thinking whether I would like to be a frontend programmer, or perhaps a backend programmer, or maybe even a full stack.
But I didn’t realize the passion I had for programming back then. When I explored and started trying out more things it was obvious that
I like to program and create applications.</p>
<p>A couple of months ago I had a thought.</p>
<p><em>What if I don’t even want to be a software engineer?</em></p>
<p>When being younger the main part of wanting to become a software engineer was of course money. Everyone knows
that software engineers make a lot of money. My family members encouraged my passion with programming and computers
because they knew I’d make a lot of money when I eventually become a software engineer.</p>
<p>But while discovering different things about the modern programming environments, reading different experiences
from people that actually worked or still work in this proffesion I realized that programming might not be
what I want to do professionally.</p>
<p>I mean I have a great passion for programming and computers in general.</p>
<p>I don’t want a work to kill this passion.</p>
<p>And it’s not like it’s very easy to get a job in programming in these times. Everyone interested in this topic
sees the layoffs by huge companies and how people struggle to find a job in this proffesion.</p>
<p>One more reason to stop considering programming as a job.</p>
<p>I just want to mention that I still go to school. I still have a couple of years to really start working.
Who knows maybe I’ll even try to apply to some university when I’ll be done with this school.</p>
<h2 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h2>
<p>Since I don’t only like programming, I like computers and technology in general, there are many paths
that I could choose as the career path. I mean there are many other types of work you can do relating to computers and whatnot.
There are people taking care of networks, there are people taking care of servers - both physically and digitally.
There are a lot of options. And there is some time left for me to make a decision.</p>
<p>Maybe when I’m done with education I should at least try to find a job and work as a software engineer for a while.
To gain the experience and then decide if I would like to still pursue that path.
But I’m really thinking that it’s not even worth at the current state of the programming environment.</p>
<h2 id="software-engineers-dont-even-program">Software Engineers don’t even program</h2>
<p>Software Engineers most of the time don’t even create software. They go to some meetings and have to talk
to annoying higher-ups that don’t even understand technology.</p>
<p>Another reason to stop considering programming as a career path…</p>
<p>At this point it’s just a faint entry in my list of things to do after finishing education.
If I see more negative experiences shared by actual software engineers on the web, or if I see
more information of how stupid is the modern programmer environment - this faint entry might just disappear.</p>
<h3 id="final-statement">Final Statement</h3>
<p>Enough of this ranting. I don’t really care if anyone reads this. I’m not popular enough to have people
reading my blog posts. I won’t share this post with anyone. If you discovered this post and decided to
read it all or just skipped to see what is here then have a good day I guess.</p>
