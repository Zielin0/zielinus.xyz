<p>This doesn’t only apply to programming. It applies to any project. In any field.</p>
<p>Unfinished projects are good and bad for you at the same time.</p>
<p>So, in this article I will explore the benefits and drawbacks of unfinished projects.</p>
<h1 id="a-picture">A Picture</h1>
<p>I can’t remember where I’ve seen this picture. I can’t find it on the internet either.</p>
<p>So I will just describe the image.</p>
<p>Picture this:</p>
<p>In the background there are unfinished houses, one of them is just built on grass from wooden</p>
<p>beams; it is not finished, there is only the frame of the house. One of the houses</p>
<p>is built with bricks but without cement to connect and join these bricks together;</p>
<p>it is not finished, there are only 2 walls built. One of them has concrete foundations and</p>
<p>some metal rods coming out of it; it is not finished as well.</p>
<p>There are some tools laying around these unfinished houses, like hammers and nails around</p>
<p>the first house, with wooden beams. Some bricks and a level around the second house. A concrete</p>
<p>mixer and some shovels around the concrete foundation; this house is not finished too.</p>
<p>In the foreground there is a man building a house. Only this time it is built properly,</p>
<p>with proper concrete foundations, tough structure. He is holding some tools that he used to make</p>
<p>this house. It is almost finished. It only needs some polish.</p>
<h1 id="the-point">The Point</h1>
<p>With that description we can derive a couple of things about unfinished projects.</p>
<h2 id="experience">Experience</h2>
<p>You gain experience in the field your project is by just working on it. You don’t have to finish it.</p>
<p>By taking on a new project, preferably a more difficult one than the last one, you have to</p>
<p>learn new things to at least go somewhere with that project. And by doing so you gain experience</p>
<p>in the field. Whatever you do. It’s just the truth, doesn’t need much explaining.</p>
<p>Just like the man trying to build a house. Tried to build a house from wood, did not succeed.</p>
<p>Then tried to build a house from bricks, did not succeed. Then tried to start with concrete</p>
<p>foundations, did not finish. But the man gained experience in building parts of a house.</p>
<p>And then he was finally able to build an actual house using his experience for every house part.</p>
<h2 id="foundations">Foundations</h2>
<p>Not only do you gain experience by working on a project, you also build foundations for</p>
<p>your future self. You get to learn what you did right and what you did wrong. Sometimes</p>
<p>these things come to you only after you decide to leave the project unfinished.</p>
<p>Like the man from the picture, every house he tried to build was some sort of foundation</p>
<p>material for his future house. So a person with right foundation material will be able to build</p>
<p>something that actually works, and something one can actually finish.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>The point doesn’t really need a separation but I thought it looked better.</p>
<p>I guess the distinction is that experience is immediate, though most of the time only can use it</p>
<p>after the project but perhaps in some cases the experience can be utilized in the project itself.</p>
<p>And foundations is a thing for a future project, something you can base the future project on.</p>
<p>Something sturdy and tough; something that won’t fail.</p>
<h1 id="getting-sht-done">Getting Sh*t Done</h1>
<p>Unfinished projects are not that bad. You learn stuff, you gain experience, you build foundations</p>
<p>for your future self. But you can’t do that forever. At some point you have to finish a project.</p>
<p>Sometimes you just have to accept that you f*cked up somewhere while working on the project,</p>
<p>and the result won’t be as good as you wanted it to be. An endless loop of unfinished projects</p>
<p>is no good. Because what’s the point of learning and all that stuff if you can’t apply it in the</p>
<p>next project? There probably is a golden ratio of unfinished and finished projects. And I guess</p>
<p>that is personal to everyone. One might prefer to have more unfinished projects and learn</p>
<p>as much as possible. One might prefer to have more finished projects.</p>
<h1 id="finishing-a-project">Finishing a Project</h1>
<p><em>Can you even finish a project?</em></p>
<p>I guess that depends on a person, again. I wanted to make a point that you can never finish a</p>
<p>project because you will always come up with something to add. Some TODO or some more polish,</p>
<p>optimizations and whatnot. But perhaps someone can finish a project. Someone that is willing</p>
<p>to accept that their project will never be perfect.</p>
<h1 id="my-experience">My Experience</h1>
<p>I have failed so many times. And I have so many unfinished projects. I always learns something</p>
<p>new tho. Don’t use OOP, or don’t use Qt6 or CMake. Stuff like that. Something that will make</p>
<p>my next project actually nice to work on. This is a blessing and a curse for me, because</p>
<p>I can learn so much but I can’t finish anything. So far at least.</p>
<p>I noticed a pattern though. The project that I leave unfinished follow this pattern:</p>
<ol>
<li>Big idea.</li>
<li>Huge motivation to work on the project.</li>
<li>Motivation gone.</li>
<li>Long break.</li>
<li>A spark of hope.</li>
<li>Decision to abandon the project.</li>
</ol>
<p>But this is a thing I learned as well, which may or may not help me finish the project I’m working</p>
<p>on right now. I relied on motivation instead of discipline. Then I got lazy, took a big break,</p>
<p>like a month or two of doing nothing or just playing around with some stuff. Then I just left</p>
<p>the project unfinished. So maybe this time I should rely on discipline, which is harder.</p>
<p>And I just can’t make long breaks. No breaks at all. Work on a project every day.</p>
<p>So what about the breaks? Perhaps these were caused by burnout, or burning out the motivation.</p>
<p>So I didn’t feel like working on a project anymore.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Unfinished projects are good for you in moderation. You just have to find a good ratio</p>
<p>of finished and unfinished projects for yourself. That is said assuming that you have a problem</p>
<p>with unfinished projects like me. And also this article is copium for me. But it’s a healthy and</p>
<p>a true cope. It’s not like you don’t learn anything from unfinished projects. If you don’t then</p>
<p>you’re clearly doing something wrong. It’s just learning from your mistakes.</p>
